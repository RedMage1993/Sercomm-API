you may upgrade firmware by using

/adm/auto_upgrade.cgi?new_fw_url=[url_to_fw_bin]

or POST'ing a base64 file. you can use Postman to post a binary

/adm/upgrade.cgi

someone mentioned V3.0.01.24 worked best for them

a user with 
iCamera2-C
F/W version: V3.0.02.35

another user with icam2-c has V3.0.02.38

maybe latest is fine
